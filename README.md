Description:
The Task Tracker is a simple Windows desktop application developed using WPF and C#. It allows users to efficiently manage tasks by adding, viewing, and tracking their progress. Each task can be customized with a name, description, due date, and completion status. The application offers a user-friendly interface where users can mark tasks as complete with a checkbox, and completed tasks are visually represented with a strikethrough on the task name.
